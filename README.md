This is a bot made with pytumblr that reblogs a random post from tumblrs inofficial weekday calendar every day.

It works by looking through the blog I linked it to for posts with tags relating to the current weekday or custom tags for non-weekly holidays.
At the moment I've got it set up to post once per launch. 

I wanted to make this public so I removed my OAuth key from this version of the file.
